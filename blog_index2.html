					</p>

If one class inherits from another then it inherits the accessible methods and variables of that class. Composition is a more explicit way to obtain the allow access to the same information in a different class as you would if the class was inheriting from another class. With composition, you call the original class instead of implicitly allowing the second class to inherit information.</p>

					</p>
					<p class="post_preview">Enumerables are a collection of classes with methods related to searching, sorting and traversing elements of an array or hash. In each class, successive elements of a collection are made available through the implementation of the each method. The method cycle is an example of one such method from the enumerable mixin.</p>
