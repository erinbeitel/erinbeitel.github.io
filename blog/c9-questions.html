        DBC Phase 1 starts tomorrow - which means a faster paced learning environment and enevitably more questions. But, what makes a question good?

        <p class="notcenter">
        According to <a href="http://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/">Jon Skeet</a>, the "Golden" rule #1 is: 'Imagine you're trying to answer the question.' If you feel like you could answer the question quickly and clearly if only you knew the answer, then you're on the right track.

        Jon goes on to highlight the importance of a good title, context, using a problem statement, including sample code and data (screenshots, I believe, would also fall into this category), spelling words correctly and using a normal username.

         Eric Steven Raymond also has a good <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">post</a> on the subject, although considerably longer than the previous two. Raymond points out 7 things to do before you ask... inlcluding searching archives of the site (e.g., Stack Overflow) you are posting on, searching the web, reading the manual, reading an FAQ, through experiementation, asking a skilled friend, or by reading the source code. Basically, he points out, if your question is lookupable, you should do so. Also, he says that when posting to sites like SO, if you have done the due dillegence of steps 1-7, you should make note of that - answerers will respect your pre-query effort. Raymon also points out the value of being simultanously concise and clear. He ends by explaining the good ettiquite of following up with a reply note to those who helped you with the "Problem X - Resolved" subject <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/tagging">tag</a>.
