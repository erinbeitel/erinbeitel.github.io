      I'm asked to refect on my take on the DBC experience, my general impression of DBC, how I see myself engaging with this type of culture, how(if) my expectations of DBC have changed, and if I'm excited to participate in this kind of learning environment or possibly nervous.

        Loving DBC and the materials so far. It's incredible how immersive the experience feels, given that Phase 0 is remote. It's really impressive how quickly and how positively the ecosystem of our cohort was created. I love how collaborative everyone is; the energy is real in this group.

        I'm really excited to be working on my hacker skills over these next few weeks in phase zero and I'm even more excited about the start of the in person component. Yoga? Um, yes please!

        If it's not already clear, I'm definately down with this coderyogi experience that is unfolding. 

        Can't wait to build cool stuff with my new DBC friends!
