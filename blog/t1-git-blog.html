  <h1>Git Blog</h1>
  <h2>Phase 0, Week 1</h2>
  <h4>May 24, 2015</h4>

  <section>

    Questions of the week: 
    What are the benefits of version control?
    How does git help you keep track of changes?
    Why use GitHub to store your code?
    </p>
     <p class="notcenter">
        Version control is used so that if there are mistakes made or breaking changes are pushed to production, code can be rolled back to a previous version and fixed before being deployed. Itâ€™s a safeguard mechanism that keeps track of what the app looked like at different points in time.
    </p>
     <p class="notcenter">
        Git is version control on your local environment (your computer) - super helpful for reviewing what was changed when and going back to a previous version of the code if something goes wrong.
    </p>
     <p class="notcenter">
        GitHub allows code to be stored on a server where it can be accessible to different members of a team while still maintaining version control. This aspect of sharability is espically useful for Open Source projects, where contributions can come from coders who discovered the public repo on GitHub and then go on to make contributions to the project.
