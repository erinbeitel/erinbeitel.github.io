          In the first week of DBC, we focused on the command line; in the second week, HTML and CSS were introduced; this week we started Ruby. Amongst the excitement: arrays and hashes.
        </p>
        <h3 class="notcenter">
          What are they are when do you use them?
        </h3>
        <p class="notcenter">
          Great question... Lets start with their similarities. Arrays and Hashes both store stuff, object type elements to be specific. They also both allow elements to be retrieved using a "key". And, they both allow methods to be called on them.
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
           How you retrieve what you've stored differs between arrays and hashes. When retrieving an element of an array, the key you use is an integer because arrays always have consequitive integer index keys. For example, names[0] would get you the first element of the array "names". If that array was <code> names = ["sara", "erykah", "sam"] </code>then, <code> names[0] </code>would return "sara". 
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
           To retrieve something stored in a hash, the key is a object. For example, in the hash "address", if you used the key "street_address" to store "park" then to access your street address you would type <code> address['street_address'] </code>which would return "park".
        </p>
        <h3 class="notcenter">
          How do you choose?
        </h3>
        <p class="notcenter">
            Arrays have the advantage of having easily accessible elements. If you wanted to iterate through the different elements of an array and access each index using an integer. You wouldn't be able to do this the same way on hashes that have non-integer keys. Hashes, although slightly more challenging to access, are useful because of the flexibilty that they provide for storing information. The key-value pair for a hash can have an integer key (ex: '5'), a string key (ex: 'hats'), a floating point key (ex: 5.55) or any other Ruby object as its key. It's common to think of a hash like a dictionary, where the key is the word that allows you to look up the associated definition.
        </p>
         <p class="notcenter">
            Declaring arrays and hashes looks quite different. To declare an array, literally, you could do this:
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
          <code>
          array = ["a", "b", "c"]
          </code>
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
          <code>
          array = []
          </code>
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
        or, to declare it using the array object's constructor, array.new, you could do this:
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
          <code>
          array = Array.new
          </code>
        </p>
         <p class="notcenter">
            A hash can be declared literally, like this: 
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
          <code>
              address = {street_address: "park", city: "chicago"}
          </code>
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
          <code>
              address = {:street_address=>"park", :city=>"chicago"}
          </code>
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
            or declaratively, using a new method, like this:
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
        <code>
              address = Hash.new
        </code>
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
        <code>
              address[:street_address] = "park"
        </code>
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
        <code>
              address[:city] = "chicago"
        </code>
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
            In some cases, both arrays and hashes are applicable but one is more advantagous. For example, if you were storing the owners of cars using their 8 digit liscense plate number, or the names of students using their 8 digit ID numbers, you would use a hash. If you used an array for this scenario, you would end up with a 100,000,000 element table to access the names associated with the 8 digit numbers. Not ideal.
