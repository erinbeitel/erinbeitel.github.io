      <h2>Phase 0, Week 3</h2>
      <h4>June 7, 2015</h4>

      <section>
        <p class="notcenter">
          In preparation for the start of Phase 0, we were asked to explore our <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a> and take <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">personal thinking style</a> quiz. Gregorc describes four thinking styles: Concrete Sequential, Abstract Sequential, Abstract Random, and Concrete Random. From this excercise, I learned that I my thinking style was the least Concrete Sequential, with a score of only 4, and much more leaning towards the other three, with a score of 32 for Abstract Sequential, a score of 40 for Abstract Random, and a score of 44 for Concrete Random.
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
          Gregorc describes two perceptual qualities: first, concrete, to be a quality that allows for the registration of information through the 5 senses, in the moment, without looking beyond into more subtle implications. He describes the second perceptual quality, abstract, to allow for visualization, ideation and using intuition to look beyond into the less concrete. This actually makes a lot of sense in relation to my work so far in phase zero. When I first learn things, I tend to be more concrete, wanting to practice the exact example in the book to make sure I understand everything before moving on. Then, once I understand the material, I'm able to apply it in the challenges and image how it could be applied in other contexts.
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
            Gregorc also describes two perceptual qualities: squential and random. Sequential is linear, step by step orgainzation while random allows information to be organized in no particular order, in chunks, starting in the middle or wherever makes the most sense. This is interesting, because in college I was very sequential. I reviewed chapters, studied for quizzes, etc. etc. in order. Sometimes going in order can be problematic if the sequence isn't required to maximize learning. For example, if I need to understand ch. 2 to understand ch.3 I obviously need to study 2 before 3. However, if I don't need to understand 2 before 3 and I'm doing so just so I can keep track of checking off what I've mastered for the quiz, then it means I didn't correctly prioritze what to study based on which areas need the most review. If I study the chapters in order and have unlimited time, all is well. If I don't review the topics I'm most confused about first and I run out of time, then I'm going to have very organized notes and a bad grade... which I figured out several times in college before making the adjustment.

        <p class="notcenter">
            The random score that I got - concrete random and abstract random being my two highest scores - is probably more of an adaptation that I've come by. I know that a little skipping around helps me not to spend too much time on any one thing, helps me to keep the bigger picture in mind, and helps me to allocate time to the things that need it most. What I learned in college making beautiful study sheets for the first half of the chapters and winging it on the second half, was that it isn't the chapters that matter - it's the topics. The reason I sometimes skip around now isn't because I'm doing topics out of order, it's because I'm paying close attention to which topics come before others and if I understand something that allows me to move on to something later I jump at the chance so see what's coming.
            I can also be a little ADD, and the chance to work on several challenges at the same time is really great for that. If I get stuck or bored on one challenge sometimes all it takes to refocus is to read an upcoming challenge and see that what I'm learning is super important for what's coming up.

            I grew up with a psychologist dad. How I do things was a focus of conversation from a pretty early age. I was never one to make decisions based on what I was good at, but rather to dive into what I was not good at. That's probably something that would come out in whole different personality questionaire, yikes..., but in any case, whether learning about your learning style helps you to create the best learning environment for yourself or to work hard at your areas of weakness, the knowledge allows some powerful informed decision making to take place.
