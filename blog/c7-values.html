          Prompt: "When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?" (list given)

        <h3 class="notcenter">
          My Values:
        </h3>

          Achievement(5), close relationships(5), committment(5), confidence(4), cooperation(4), decisiveness(4), inspiration(4), integrity(5), knowledge(5), and meaningful work(5).

          In general, I try to live up to these values:

          Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree (see answers in parenthesis above)

          Achievement:
        </h3>
        <p class="notcenter">
          In particular achievement is particularly important to me in tough situations. I think the in-person component at DBC will probably most resemble my experience at institute before TFA. That was a 5-6 week, very intense, bootcamp experience where I was asked to read a stack of books in advance, teach with a team of 3 other teachers, take clases, review my performance, track my students' data, and rapidly turn over how I approached teaching for ever increasing performance. That was a tough experience, but trusting the person who was leading me and knowing that making the changes she was suggesting was translating to powerful improvements in my students' performance was very importing to me. In tough situations like this, making data driven decisions about where to focus effort allows the most important areas of improvement to be identified as the highest priorities.

          Last week I wrote a reflection about <a href="http://erinbeitel.github.io/blog/c6-steriotype-threat.html">Steriotype Threat</a> and my experience as a physics major.
