      <h2>My Experience as a Physics Major</h2>
      <!-- <h2>Phase 0, Week 4</h2> -->

          Physics can be a frustrating major. It starts off very concrete but it becomes abstract and very mathematical quite quickly after the first few semesters. There is inherently an expanse of space for one to question ones abilities and capabilities in such a context.

          I went to school in Texas and majored in physics. In my graduating class there were about 8 physics majors and I was the only girl. Until my last year of college, all of the professors in the department were men, and even the secretary was a man.

          In the situation I was in, I had a hard time finding someone to relate to. The boys in my physics class had their physics parties and I had my sorority parties; they had their online gaming and I had soccer. We were really different. They seemed so smart and it felt like their nerdiness went hand in hand with their intelligence; I wondered if maybe my brain just wasn't wired in this special crazy smart physics way that theirs was.

          In my electronics lab I was pretty confused right from the start. My partner, lets call him Steve, was punching buttons and turning knobs like our oscilloscope was the car radio. Steve was so smart. My professor loaned me his lab manual from his electronics class at Harvard (The Student Manual for the Art of Electronics by Hayes and Horowitz) so that I could do some supplemental reading.
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
          The 615 page lab manual starts chapter 1 with a page and a half of simply talking down the reader. "We should also restate a word of reassurance offered by the Text (p.29), but seldom believed by students: you can manage this course perfectly even if you cannot follow the mathematical arguments that begin in sec. 1.18 (use of complex quantities to represent voltage and current), and even if, after reading the spectacularly-dense Math Review in appendix B you feel that you must be spectacularly dense. This is the place in the Text and course where the squeamish usually begin to wonder if they ought to retreat to some slower-paced treatment of the subject. Do not give up at this point; hang on until you have seen transistors, at least. The mathematically arguments of 1.18 are not at all characteristic of the Text or of this course. [...] The treatment of transistors offers a good example, and you ought to stay with the course long enough to see that: the transistor chapter is difficult, but wonderfully simpler than most other treatments of the subject."
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
          The author goes on to say "It is also in the first three labs that you will get used to the lab instruments - and especially important of these, the oscilloscope. It is a complex machine; only practice will teach you to use it well. Do not make the common mistake of thinking that the person next to you who is turning knobs so confidently, flipping switches and adjusting the trigger level - all on the first day of the course - is smarter than you are. No, that person has done it before. In two weeks, you too will be making the scope do your bidding - assuming you don't leave the work to that person next to you - who knew it all from the beginning." I remember exactly where I was sitting when I read this. The author totally got me! My lab partner was doing exactly what he described and I had been thinking he was smarter than me exactly as he was warning against!

          In really challenging subject matter there exists the opportunity for us to question ourselves, for whatever reason. Understanding that this is natural is very powerful. 
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
          No one will ever understand us better than we understand ourselves. When we understand ourselves, and capabilities, we cultivate that understanding in those around us and understanding this is equally powerful. When we question ourselves we compromise our ability to succeed.

          I did TFA after college and while I was teaching I explained to my students that the feeling of confusion, the one that feels a tiny bit like someone squeezing your brain, is the feeling of learning. I explained to them that this is a feeling to embrace as new neural pathways are developing. It's not the feeling of something being too hard or them not being smart enough. I explained to them that if they were training for a sport, just the same as they would not stop running or lifting weights because it felt challenging, as this challenging feeling is associated with getting in better shape, they cannot avoid this feeling academically that is associated with learning.

          In the video below Professor Claud Steel talks about lifting the Stereotype Threat for an experiment he was running by norming expectations. In a similar way, it can be very powerful for us to go into situations with expectations that accommodate for confusion, setbacks, and the chance to see obstacles as learning opportunities as opposed to reflections on our aptitude.
