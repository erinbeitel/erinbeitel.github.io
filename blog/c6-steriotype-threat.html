          I went to school in Texas and majored in physics. In my graduating class there were about 8 physics majors and I was the only girl. Until my last year of college, all of the professors in the department were men, and even the secretary was a man.

          Physics can be a frustrating major. It starts off very concrete but it becomes abscract and very mathmatical quite quickly after the first few semesters. There is inherantly an expanse of space for one to question ones abilities and capibilities in such a context.

          In the situation I was in, I had a hard time finding someone to relate to. The boys in my physics class had their physics parties and I had my sorority parties; they had their online gaming and I had soccer. We were so different.
