      <h2>A Look at Gregorc Thinking Styles</h2>
      <!-- <h2>Phase 0, Week 3</h2> -->
      <h4>June 7, 2015</h4>

      <section>
        <p class="notcenter">
          In preparation for the start of Phase 0, we were asked to explore our <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a> and take a <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">personal thinking style</a> quiz. Gregorc describes four thinking styles: Concrete Sequential, Abstract Sequential, Abstract Random, and Concrete Random. From this excercise, I learned that I my thinking style was the least Concrete Sequential, with a score of only 4, and much more leaning towards the other three, with a score of 32 for Abstract Sequential, a score of 40 for Abstract Random, and a score of 44 for Concrete Random.
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
            Gregorc describes two perceptual qualities: first, concrete, to be a quality that allows for the registration of information through the 5 senses, in the moment, without looking beyond into more subtle implications. He describes the second perceptual quality, abstract, to allow for visualization, ideation and using intuition to look beyond into the less concrete. The coexistance of these two attributes in my score actually makes a lot of sense in relation to my work so far in Phase 0. When I first learn new information, I tend to be more concrete, wanting to test the exact method in the book - to make sure I understand each element before reading on. Then, once I understand the material, I'm able to apply it in the challenges and imagine how it could be applied in other contexts.
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
            Gregorc also describes two perceptual qualities: "squential" and "random". Sequential is linear, step-by-step, orgainzation, while random allows information to be organized in no particular order, in chunks, starting in the middle or wherever makes the most sense. This is interesting, because in college I was very sequential. I always reviewed chapters, studied for quizzes, etc. in order. Sometimes going in order can be problematic if the sequence isn't required to maximize learning. For example, if I need to understand chapter 2 to understand chapter 3, I obviously need to study 2 before 3. However, if I don't need to understand 2 before 3 and I'm doing so just so I can keep track of checking off what I've mastered for the quiz, then it means I didn't correctly prioritze what to study based on which areas need the most review. If I study the chapters in order and have unlimited time, all is well. If I don't review the topics I'm most confused about first and I run out of time, then I'm going to have very organized notes and a bad grade... which I figured out on several occasions in college before making the adjustment.
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
            The "random" score that I got - concrete random and abstract random being my two highest scores - is probably an adaptation from my perfect notes experience in college. I know that a little skipping around helps me not to spend too much time on any one thing, helps me to keep the bigger picture in mind, and helps me to allocate time to the topics that need the most review. What I learned in college making beautiful study sheets for the first half of the chapters and winging it on the second half because I ran out of time, was that it isn't the chapters that matter - it's the topics. The reason I sometimes skip around now isn't because I'm doing topics out of order, it's because I'm paying close attention to which topics are prerequests of others and if I understand something that allows me to move on to something later - why not?!
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
            Being comfortable out of order also helps me to work in groups. In college, with my perfect sequential study guide plan, it was really hard for me to attend study groups for exactly the same reason my quiz grade wasn't always perdictable based on how many hours I studied - I was only ready to review the first set of chapters and when the group skipped around (or when the quiz skipped around)... I got confused. Not just quizzes and study groups, but life skips around, as it turns out. I had to learn to focus on topics, to prioritize those that I understood the least and to identify others containing prerequesite knowledge. I found that the payoff for letting go of the sequential and embracing chunks of well prioitized information was speed. Speed is good.

            We were also asked to read about Carol Dweck's concept of <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Fixed vs Growth Mindset</a>. Dweck highlights the idea that intelligence isn't static - it can be developed - and thus success and failure are not affirmations of who we are. A growth mindset thrives on challenge and sees failures as learning opportunities.

            <!-- I grew up with a psychologist dad. How I did things was a focus of conversation from a pretty early age. I was never one to make decisions based on what I was good at, but rather to dive into learning what I was not good at. As a child, this meant I was rarely the very best at anything but over years of making decisions based on what I wasn't good at, I became rather good at quickly learning new skills.  -->Whether reading about your learning style helps you to create the best learning environment for yourself or helps you to work hard in your areas of weakness, the knowledge allows for some very powerful, informed, decision making to take place.
