          There has never been a better time in the history of our country to be an individual with a good idea. Startups all over the world are challenging the status quo; giving a voice to users long taken for granted by big business. This innovation is not only changing the way we solve problems as a society, but itâ€™s changing the way we generate problem solving ideas.

          Amidst the distruption and transformation of the tech industry resides incredible inequity. Only 10% of those working in tech in San Francisco are women and between 0.1-0.3% are black or latino women. In comparison to law and medicine, where women make up almost exactly half of the workforce, the imbalence in technology is surprising.

          Taking a step back from race and gender for a moment, one in five children in this country grow up in poverty and 92% of those kids do not go on to graduate from four-year universities. Programming, in particular, is not a field where a college degree is required but the same challenges of academic preparedness that face youth growing up in underserved communities affect their competitivness for jobs in the tech sector. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="notcenter">
          Why does this matter?
        </h3>
        <p class="notcenter">
          When some of our country's biggest problems are faced by the smallest percentage of our tech innovators, the domain knowledge (including understandings of educational inequity, situations of poverty and variables affecting marganalized communities) to create transformative change doesn't exist in very high numbers.   
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
          There are two sides of the diversity issue: 1) who is working in tech and 2) for whom is our tech being built. Our tech is not being built for the 20% of American youth who are growing up in poverty and it certiantly is not being built by a strong representation of engineers who grew up in our country's roughest neighborhoods. The existance of this particular lack of ecconomic diversity limits innovation in some of the areas that need it most: poverty and education.   
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
          The education industry is a 4.6 Trillion dollar market with a 0.1 Trillion dollar market capitalization. The 2% capitalization of the education industry is in stark contrast to the 80% capitalization of the 6.5 Trillion dollar health care market and the 81% capitalization of the 1.7 Trillion dollar media and entertainment industry.

        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
          To innovate in our country's highest need communities we need to empower the voices of those communities. We need to cultivate transformative solutions that combat barriers that exist for people growing up in marginalized communities. We need to make sure that high tech environments, positioned for rapid innovation, are working on problems with the most valuable solutions not just those with the safest returns.
