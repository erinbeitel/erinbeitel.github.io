      <h2>The Pair Programming Experience</h2>
      <!-- <h2>Phase 0, Week 4</h2> -->
      <h4>June 22, 2015</h4>

          Pair programming is the process of two developers working together to solve a programming challenge, each alternating between writing code ("driving") and providing direction ("navigating"). Particularly useful to get past a challenging roadblock, or when learning new techniques, pair programming pushes developers to communicate about why and what they are doing at a higher level than would be required during a solo session. 
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
          When working with a pair, it's essential that both members of the pair understand the code that has been written and the overal plan of attack for moving forward. Pairings usually start by reviewing the challenge and writing pseudocode for the solution. Creating pseudocode allows ideas to be flushed out before the actual coding begins. Often times ideas develop during this time and changes are made that would have taken much more time to discover once the code was being written.

          My pair programming experience:
        </h3>
        <p class="notcenter">
          Every pairing experience is a little different and I've learned something uniquely valuable in each of them. I've found it partiuclarly rewarding to discuss with my pair how we would each solve the problem and then to bring a hybrid of our ideas to life. In the first few weeks, I felt like I was learning a lot from my pairings but that the code we were writing together was probably not as strong as the code that either of us would have written alone. What I'm finding now, as we become better at programming, better at communicating about code, and better at pairing, is that the solutions that come out of my pairings are becoming quite strong, because of the coming together of our respective strengths. Everyone is developing their own style of coding, and sharing as we go diversifies everyone's skills and, through the pairing dialogue, deepends everyones understanding of the underlying concepts.

          Receiving feedback:
        </h3>
        <p class="notcenter">
          After a pairing session, each of the pairs gives the other feedback. Getting feedback is really helpful. I find giving feedback to help me think through not only how my pair did but what types of things I should keep in mind as well. I feel like as time passes we are learning to give eachother higher quality feedback and we are feeling more comfortable including constructive feedback, which is incredibly helpful to receive. It's really exciting to see new feedback pop up in my dashboard - I enjoy knowing what my pairs thought about our pairing and about my contribution.
        </p>
        <p class="notcenter">
          Overall, I feel like the experience of pair programming and giving and receiving feedback is really accelerating my learning. I'm learning so much from other people sharing their thought process with me while they code and giving me feedback on the process I'm sharing.
